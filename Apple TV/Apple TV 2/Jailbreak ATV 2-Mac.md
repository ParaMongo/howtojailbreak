# How To Jailbreak ATV 2

First, before we begin you will need 6 things:

1. Apple TV
2. Apple TV Remote
3. Micro USB cable
4. HDMI Cable
5. AC adapter for the Apple TV
6. Mac Computer


### Step 1

Download the latest version of Seas0nPass from [Firecore](https://support.firecore.com/hc/en-us/articles/215090347-Jailbreaking-101-Seas0nPass) or click the link below
[Mac](https://github.com/firecore/Seas0nPass/releases/download/0.9.8/Seas0nPass.zip)


### Step 2

Connect your ATV to the computer with the Micro-USB cable. Do NOT plug the AC adapter into the ATV. You should see the white light on the front of the ATV flashing.


### Step 3

Next, open Seas0nPass, grant it administrative permissions, and once it is open, press the "Create IPSW" button. It will then proceed to download the Seas0nPass IPSW file, from which it restore your ATV. It can take a while.


### Step 4 

After the IPSW is finished downloading, Seas0nPass will ask you to put your ATV into DFU (recovery) mode. To do this, take the Apple TV Remote, point it at the Apple TV, and hold down the Play/Pause button, and the Menu button at the same time for about 7 seconds. You should see the flashing light on the front start to flicker really quickly before you let go. Once you let go, Seas0nPass will continue the rest of the Jailbreak.


### Step 5

Once complete, you can plug your ATV into your TV using the HDMI adapter, and the AC power adapter. Setup your ATV as normal and once your finished setting up, look at the settings app and you will see the FireCore symbol letting you know your TV is Jailbroken.
