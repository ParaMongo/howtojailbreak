# Jailbreak Apple TV 3

You will need:

1. Apple TV 3 (Model A1469) connected to your TV and power.
2. Apple TV remote.


### Step 1

Make sure your Apple TV is connected to the internet, either wirelessly or ethernet.


### Step 2

Go to the `Settings` app, then under `General` select Network. Next, click the network you are currently on, and you should see network options come up. Go down to the DNS where it says `Automatic` and change it to Manual by clicking it.


### Step 3

You should see a seperate page come up asking for a DNS, replace the current DNS with: **45.166.144.59**


### Step 4

After you have entered the correct DNS and saved it, go back to the Main Menu by holding down the Menu button on the remote. Next, go back into the `Settings` app and click on the `General` once more. Scroll down until you see *`Send Data to Apple`*. You must scroll over top of the `Send Data to Apple` button, but do not click it (if you did it's no big deal, just press the menu button once to go back), instead press the *Play/Pause* button on the remote. 


### Step 5

You will then see a new menu come up asking to add a profile, click add profile and type: `http://trailers.apple.com/trailers.cer`

Click submit.


### Step 6

Return to the Main Menu by holding the menu button for a few seconds, then go to the Trailers app. Click it, and you should see a *#etason* come up, and click it. Your Apple TV will restart, and once it has, you are jailbroken. You can reset the DNS back to automatic after it is turned on.

You can now SSH into your Apple TV via any SSH client. The default password is `Alpine` therefor it is highly recommended you change it.
