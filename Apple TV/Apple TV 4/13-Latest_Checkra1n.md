# Jailbreak Apple TV 4 (Checkra1n)


##### **Currently, this Jailbreak is only possible with a Mac device, stay tuned for Windows updates!!**

You will need:

1. Apple TV 4 connected to your TV and power.
2. Apple TV remote.
3. HDMI cable
4. AC Adapter
5. USB-C cable


### Step 1

This Jailbreak uses Checkra1n, if you don't have it already, you can get it from [checkra.in](checkra.in/releases) or this direct download here: [0.9.7](https://assets.checkra.in/downloads/macos/a43bdd2a64967b70cda422b26e8e5585d7c37c28cbe42a67474143b5de586000/checkra1n%20beta%200.9.7.dmg)


### Step 2

Once you have downloaded Checkra1n, you must move it to the Applications folder, and then Right Click and press open. Your computer will ask you if you want to open it, click open.


### Step 3

You must next connect your Apple TV 4 to your computer via a USB-C and also connect the Apple TV to a power source via the AC adapter. It should then show up in the top of Checkra1n


### Step 4

Make sure your device is connected to a TV, or you are able to connact it to a TV directly after you are finished Jailbreaking it because if the power gets disconnected from the Apple TV, you will have to rejailbreak it.


### Step 5

Hit `Start` on the Checkra1n app, and it should put your Apple TV into recovery mode, Checkra1n will prompt you to put your device into DFU mode by holding the `Play/Pause' and the `Menu` buttons at the same for about 7 seconds. Follow the instructions on the Checkra1n app.


### Step 6

You'll then see a success, the device will reboot, you can then plug the ATV into your TV to set it up. You can also disconnect your USB-C once everything is working properly. 


##### If your ATV disconnects from power for any reason and restarts, the Jailbreak will be lost since this is an Semi-Tethered Jailbreak, all you have to do is follow the Steps again to re-jailbreak it, and all your settings and files you had on it when it was disconnected from power will come back.
