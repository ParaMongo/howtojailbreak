## Important Information

### So, is jailbreak illegal?

The short answer is: /*No, jailbreaking is not illegal.*/ Jailbreaking officially became legal in 2012 when the Library of Congress made an exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, allowing users to jailbreak their iPhones. However, iPads didn’t become legal to jailbreak until a couple of months ago, surprisingly.

This means that if you’ve been jailbreaking your iPad for years now, you were technically committing a crime.

Again, jailbreaking can be seen as mostly harmless, but there are some things you can do with it that allow you to actually break the law, like not paying for a paid service, but getting it for free. For instance, a jailbreak app called Flex 2 allows you to get RunKeeper Go features for free, which is a service that normally costs $10 per month.

### What does jailibreaking do?

Jailbreaking allows you to be free of certian restrictions Apple places on your device. You can change settings, such as how your control centre looks or functions with a tweak called *Cool CC*. You can make your passcode a drawing instead of a number pad using *Scribble* and these are just small examples of how you can change your device! There are billions of ways you can customize your device to the way you like it!

For Apple TV users, you can add XBMC or Kodi, a massive multimedia centre, to your Apple TV, and you can link it to cloud networks to play all your favourite movies and shows!


### Minimizing Risks

Okay so I'm ready to Jailbreak, what's next? Well first, you need to be aware of the risks you run by Jailbreaking. Since you are Jailbreaking your device, it will void any warranty from Apple, but worse, there is a chance you could *brick* your device, making it unusable. Usually you can just restore the device and it will go back to the way it was prior to when you jailbroke it. Restoring, should you have to, will also remove all the data on your device, which is why it's important to create a backup before you start: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977

*Please be aware that Github, the owners contributors and members of this repository are not responsible for any damage done to your device. I have personally done many of these jailbreaks over the years, and while most worked for me, none of them ever caused me data loss, or rendering them unusable due to the jailbreak (rather me getting frustrated and throwing my ATV 2 at a wall O_o*


### I'm Ready

Now to get started, you need to look up at the diectories above to find your device. Just double click the folder of the category you are Jailbreaking. If you are jailbreaking an iPhone, you would select the iPhone folder, then read the versions list to get find your version of iPhone.
