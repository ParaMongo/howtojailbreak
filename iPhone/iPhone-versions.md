Please note that your software may not match the ones shown above, this means you are on an older version of IOS. You should most likely KEEP that version of IOS because it will keep your Phone running faster, and it's probably Jailbreakable. If you are not able to Jailbreak on that version of IOS, in order to Jailbreak, you must update to one of the signed version of IOS (Shown in the list above) and follow it's subsequent Jailbreaking process. IN GENERAL, in the Jailbreaking community, updating is BAD, so try not to do it, if you don't have to.
